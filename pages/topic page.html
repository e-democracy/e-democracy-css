      <pre class="email-body entry-content">Once again noise battered neighbors came through with flying colors! At the
Airplane Noise meeting last evening, it was truly gratifying to see so many of
our neighbors come forward and stand up for our neighborhoods and our quality
of life. A special shout out to Powderhorn's Cate Long who bundled up her one
year old daughter and came and spoke from the heart all the while bouncing hey
baby on her hip - what a trooper!
I video recorded the FAA's presentation and will post it on YouTube and drop a
note here when it goes up. The presentation was the FAA's response to the
public meeting in October where we complained loudly about the new and
deafening noise over all neighborhoods from Powderhorn to the airport. There
was a lot of information delivered via a PowerPoint presentation that can be
summarized as follows:
a) There are 33% more flights over our neighborhood since the FAA changed
procedures due to a near collision situation that happened in September, 2010.
b) Many of the flights are lower than what we have experienced in the past; the
reason for this remains unknown.
It would be fair to say that we grilled the FAA pretty hard on certain points
they presented. But they are either unable or unwilling to explain why our
noise level has so greatly increased since the near collision incident. It
would seem entirely logical to state that we have substantially more noise
because of the 33% more flights and the lower flights. But my take on this is
the noise has far more to do with the lower elevation the planes are now flying
over us than it does with the number of flights. (We weren't complaining when
the flights were higher, only when they got lower.)
Technically, the FAA stated they do not require the airlines to take off at any
particular angle of ascent - this is left up to the airlines! The FAA sees it's
role as doing all it can to accomodate the needs of the airlines. They have
some sort of guidance that goes something like this: Move the airplanes through
as quickly as possible while doing it safely. There is no consideration given
to the effect of noise on the ground. Please expand on this or correct me if
this is inaccurate.
There is much more to say, those who attended the meeting, please add your
coments or corrections. I'll post some concluding information when I upload the
video to YouTube and post a notice here.

    <div class="email-message">
      <pre class="email-body entry-content">My impressions from the meeting.  I’ll keep it short and sweet but there was a
lot.

These are only my notes and I only speak for myself.   I am only speaking about
the Standish-Ericsson area, so if someone has something to add or change,
please do so responsibly.  I know that emotions are high.

The meeting started at 7pm and ended close to 10:30pm and we were engaged the
entire time.  The FAA presenter was very good.  I encourage you to view his
PowerPoint on the MAC Noise website though I can’t promise it will make sense
without his narrative.  The FAA presentation did confirm our belief that there
are more planes flying north, flying at a lower altitude, all while
concentrated approximately between Cedar and 28th Ave.  That is practically ALL
of Standish and Corcoran.

There was ZERO data on physical noise in the FAA presentation, because the
presentation was not designed to address or research noise issues, only
designed to address and research potential changes in airport and flight
operations.

Even though there was no noise data, the FAA presentation worked in favor of
our neighborhoods.

&gt;From the presentation, we now know the following:
•	Much of this new concentration of flights over our neighborhood is within the
last one year.
•	The airlines control the type of planes they fly, the schedule they fly, the
speed of the plane and other pilot decisions.
•	Pilots will not willingly fly low and slow.  Speed and altitude are their
most important friends.
•	Flight decisions are based on safety, weather, volume of flights in and out
of the airport, and amount of passengers. There are other issues as well, but
those are the main concerns for airport operations.  These decision factors
change daily and the airport, the MAC and the FAA have little to no control
over these issues.
•	Because the airlines control the type of planes flown etc, some days a DC-9
may fly to Denver, the next day a smaller and quieter airplane may fly the same
route.
•	There are less propeller powered planes out of MSP.  This significantly
changes how the faster and more powerful jet powered planes can take-off and
operate.
•	Because of the September 10th near miss, depending on the final destination
planes now must take off from specific runways.
•	There are few exceptions to the runway rules, mostly with really big and
heavy planes like the 777 and 747 to Asia or that damn giant FedEx Airbus 330
that is our neighborhood White Whale (Aye, aye! It was that accursed white
whale that razed me; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!....)
•	Because the mix of airplanes has changed, jets can now take off faster and
turn sooner to their destination.  (This is why they are concentrating over our
neighborhood.)
•	The FAA flight instructions given to the airlines and to pilots have
technically not changed in 10 years.  The flight pattern change to our
neighborhood is from the mix of faster aircraft and the (safety first) runways
utilized.

This new mix of largely jet aircraft, now having to use the two runways that
take-off to the north over our neighborhood for safety issues, can take off
faster, and condense their take-off patterns more tightly.  This means
considerably more air traffic over the unmitigated areas surrounding Lake
Nokomis, Lake Hiawatha, Hiawatha Golf Course, 42nd St and all points north.

Those are the details as I remember them.  The meeting was contentious in
parts, repetitive in others, but in my opinion the FAA and the MAC are open to
ideas to address our noise concerns.  We also have some very erudite and
passionate neighbors, maybe they could join SENA?

However, what was shown about airport operations and airplane types, plus a
recovering economy leading to more future flights it’s my opinion this noise is
probably here to stay.  It’s an airport in a city and we live by it – but yes I
am upset that things have changed because like others, I purchased using the
noise contour maps that showed my little slice of SMPLS to be quieter than
others.   But from this meeting, I believe the flights and patterns are
probably here to stay in some current capacity.

My major concern take away from this meeting was a side comment made about how
noise is actually measured. We got a strange answer about how the noise
monitoring stations actually don't impact the noise contour mapping used to
establish mitigation eligible properties, but instead a whole bunch of data
EXCLUSIVE of the noise monitoring stations in our neighborhood!   Holy cow I
hope I am wrong on that one....

We must better understand the noise mapping, because as of right now the MAC is
saying that they will support exploring moving the mitigation lines to the 60
DBL contours, where now that stop is at 65 DBL.  This is very important.

So personally I will be pressing Councilmember Colvin-Roy and Councilmember
Quincy, plus the MAC and the NOC, to change the eligible mitigation contours to
60 DBL so that at least I can have some respite while in my house.  That is
where I see the most value and the most opportunity for me and my family,
though I understand others feel differently.  I do hope others will join me in
pressing for mitigation in concert with other neighbors who will lead the
charge to try to change the flight patterns to their historic routes.</pre><!--email-body-->

    <div class="email-message">
      <pre class="email-body entry-content">I think it is important to stress that the FAA is concerned with airplane
SAFETY.  They don't tell the airlines what planes to fly, what flights to make,
what airplanes to purchase, or when to fly (in terms of scheduling).  They make
sure that the flights requested have a safe departure...that's all they're
worried about.  If the maximum capacity of outgoing flights at MSP is 100,
they'll let all 100 through...but will stop any above that.  As long as the
requests are below their safety capability standard, they don't care how many
flights go per hour.

The controllers want the planes in the air as soon as possible....and I would
expect the pilots do, too.  I don't know about you, but even if no one is on
the interstate, I still accelerate to the expected rate of travel before
merging into the lane.  I will make a huge assumption here and say I would
expect that pilots "gun it" to get to the required minimum threshold as it's
generally safer in the air than on the ground.

As for requiring a degree of ascent, the FAA doesn't do that.  It is
unreasonable to assume that the same type of plane could fly in the exact same
manner with no regard for weather conditions, fuel, passengers, and/or whatever
other factors pilots have to consider.  Furthermore, since we have no
structural factors to consider (mountains, tall buildings) so the FAA doesn't
seem to have a safety protocol based on ascent.  As mentioned last night,
pilots were getting confused because of the specific airport rules and
regulations which is why airports streamlined their requirements for pilots.
(Which I could be bungling up...)

There was plenty of talk about "moving the track."  Why don't pilots just turn
later?  This is something we need to discuss with our council members.  The
pilots are given the okay by the FAA to turn north over our neighbourhoods when
they reach that ascent threshold minimum.  From where I sit, our problem is
that planes are accelerating just fine which allows them to cross over our
neighbourhoods quicker than they have in the past.

With regards to fanning: the FAA doesn't send planes over certain
neighbourhoods.  The protocol seems to be "hit your first ascent threshold and
turn north"...there is no fanning.  By sending planes parallel on a northbound
course, the planes are safer.  Thus, if we have 35 planes taking off from the
north runway that generally have the same ascent capabilities, they'll all be
headed north over the same line.

With all this said, the FAA is only concerned about PLANE safety.  Therefore,
if we want to incite some kind of change we need to speak with our council
members who deal directly with NOC....who, based on last night's meeting...are
WAITING for a recommendation from Minneapolis residents.  Please keep this in
mind when we go to these meetings guns-blazin' - it is prudent to remain
somewhat calm in the face of adversity.  We have some great people working on
our behalf and thus far our questions have been answered in a fair and
satisfactory manner.

That said, I want to thank everyone who attended.  I appreciated the input and
was glad we didn't have to resort to name calling and derision.

Have you called your council member today?  :p

      <pre class="email-body entry-content">Nice recap, Kyle!

One last thing - with regards to changes, Mr. Rydeen (FAA) said that they are
in the process of determining the ARNAV routes.  (ARNAV = area navigation)
Currently they are working on comprehensive gps paths that would allow planes
to follow the river.  They plan on expanding the routes to also work over major
thoroughfares.  Where it gets dicey for us is there are no major north-south
roads in SMPLS.  Would Cedar Avenue be considered the best bet?  What about
Portland?  Or would they move all the way over to 35W?  (Fingers crossed!)

Council Member Colvin-Roy may be the best person to petition for answers
regarding this as she has a tie to a group related to enviromental assessment.</pre><!--email-body-->

      <pre class="email-body entry-content">Michael, Thank you for recording the audio/video for the entire meeting!

Everyone,
At last nights meeting we learned from a City Council Member from Apple Valley
who also is a member of the NOC, that a week earlier at the NOC meeting, the
NOC, MAC, and FAA invited Council members Colvin Roy and Quincy to  propose
formal solutions to the airport noise problem on behalf of the residents in our
wards.  The NOC, MAC, and FAA are waiting to receive and review proposal(s)
from our City Council so that their organizations could proceed to alter our
situation with airplane noise ...if our council members proposed solutions are
acceptable.  The NOC, MAC, and FAA again extended that invitation to Council
Member Colvin-Roy last night during the meeting.  They claim their
organizations must have proposal(s) to review from our city representatives
before they can actually act on residents behalf to remedy our airplane noise
problem.
By gaining that knowledge I think we have made some progress towards a remedy.

We learned that during that NOC meeting a week earlier our Council Members
Colvin-Roy and Quincy had not anticipated the invitation for a proposal to be
extended to them (it was quite a surprise) and so they had not shown up to that
NOC meeting with proposals.  Before offering a proposal Council member
Colvin-Roy told us that she wants to do the right thing by meeting with
residents from her district as well as other council members representing other
districts of the city to work on proposal(s) for solutions that are fair to all
wards in Minneapolis. Council Member Colvin-Roy stated during last nights
meeting that our wards degree of noise cannot revert back 100% to the old noise
amounts which had been acceptable to residents because it would be unfair to
shift the entirety of a new noise problem from one district to another, causing
it to fully be another wards problem.

Council Member Quincy sits on the NOC and should have some insight they could
share with us about the proposal process.  Any proposals for our ward should
funnel through Quincy.

I am looking forward to reading posts from both Council Members Colvin-Roy and
Quincy here on this forum.  The sooner we can gather the neighborhood(s) and
council members to work on proposals - the sooner we can get closer to the
possibility of some kind of relief from the airplane noise.</pre><!--email-body-->

    <div class="email-message">
      <pre class="email-body entry-content">Many key points from Tuesday’s NOC Public Input meeting have already been made,
thank you to all who have posted.  I would like to add my perspective and
perhaps clarify a few things.  The FAA report confirmed that what we have said
is true: there are more flights, flying at lower altitudes, leaving the runway
sooner and turning earlier.  The intervals between flights are also shorter.
The analysis and report came as a response to a formal inquiry from the City.
We believe that establishing these facts is critical to our ability to confront
this issue. Now, no one can deny these facts.

I want to clarify what happened at the Noise Oversight Committee meeting last
week. The committee was being asked to make some decisions related to the
airport’s 2020 improvements plan.  The plan makes predictions about the numbers
of passengers and potential changes at the airport and then predicts the
impacts on area residents (including noise) in the form of noise contours.  The
committee was asked to approve or deny a sound mitigation plan for certain
Minneapolis homes based on these projections.  CM Quincy and I argued that the
vote was premature because we do not yet know what homes will need mitigation.
Here’s why: We know that MSP wants to implement new performance based
navigation (PBN) practices and that the FAA will present proposed new flight
tracks in March.  We have not taken a position for or against.  But if those
tracks are going to change where the planes are flying, then we do not know
what the noise impacts will look like in 2020.  I argued strenuously that we
need to know where the planes will really be flying before establishing a map
for sound mitigation but the committee voted to tell MAC to go ahead with the
sound mitigation plan based on a map already produce.

We are concerned that by agreeing to the specific contours on the map we would
foreclose the opportunity for mitigation in areas affected by different
procedures in the future.  We documented our objections and will continue this
fight on to the MAC.

Regarding the 60 dnl (as mentioned by Kyle). The city took actions to formally
establish 60 dnl as the standard in our community for sound mitigation.  Our
approach of asking MAC to use the locally adopted community standard (noise
mitigation to the 60 dnl contour) succeeded. It is a big victory that MAC staff
used our local standard in preparing the map they are recommending and which
the NOC approved as an advisory to the MAC.  I appreciate that and acknowledged
on Tuesday night that it is a huge move, beyond what any other airport in the
country has done.

Tuesday night, the FAA and MAC said they are waiting for the City’s input about
where planes should go. While Carl Rydeen of FAA made an offer that we are
following up, it was not very clear what was being offered. Another issue is
that we have not seen any proposed PBN procedures yet – they will be created by
the FAA, not the City - and they could impact everything. The FAA is scheduled
to present on RNAV to the NOC in March.  Federal and state requirements, as
well as plain old decency, require a process of review for those proposals–
with a public hearing and a separate EA.  This is not simply in the hands of
Minneapolis.  A careful evaluation of these proposed procedures and corridors
will be needed and you will be engaged in that process (as well as residents of
surrounding cities.)

Now that we are armed with facts about what is going on above our
neighborhoods, we are exploring what can improve the situation.  Some things we
would ask for include not allowing planes to leave the runway early, not
allowing early turns, requiring planes to climb to a certain altitude above our
homes and lengthening the intervals between take-offs.  Carl Rydeen has stated
that none of these changes are possible due to FAA regulations.  If Mr. Rydeen
is constrained by FAA rules, then we will fight to change the rules.

The city has been very aggressively working on this issue since it first came
to our attention last summer.  I personally devote a lot of time to this
because it is a high priority. Please be assured - I’m fighting for you.

&gt; Many key points from Tuesday’s NOC Public Input meeting have already been
made, thank you to all who have posted.  I would like to add my perspective and
perhaps clarify a few things.  The FAA report confirmed that what we have said
is true: there are more flights, flying at lower altitudes, leaving the runway
sooner and turning earlier.  The intervals between flights are also shorter.
The analysis and report came as a response to a formal inquiry from the City.
We believe that establishing these facts is critical to our ability to confront
this issue. Now, no one can deny these facts.
&gt;
&gt; I want to clarify what happened at the Noise Oversight Committee meeting last
week. The committee was being asked to make some decisions related to the
airport’s 2020 improvements plan.  The plan makes predictions about the numbers
of passengers and potential changes at the airport and then predicts the
impacts on area residents (including noise) in the form of noise contours.  The
committee was asked to approve or deny a sound mitigation plan for certain
Minneapolis homes based on these projections.  CM Quincy and I argued that the
vote was premature because we do not yet know what homes will need mitigation.
Here’s why: We know that MSP wants to implement new performance based
navigation (PBN) practices and that the FAA will present proposed new flight
tracks in March.  We have not taken a position for or against.  But if those
tracks are going to change where the planes are flying, then we do not know
what the noise impacts will look like in 2020.  I argued strenuousl
&gt; y that we need to know where the planes will really be flying before
establishing a map for sound mitigation but the committee voted to tell MAC to
go ahead with the sound mitigation plan based on a map already produce.
&gt;
&gt; We are concerned that by agreeing to the specific contours on the map we
would foreclose the opportunity for mitigation in areas affected by different
procedures in the future.  We documented our objections and will continue this
fight on to the MAC.
&gt;
&gt; Regarding the 60 dnl (as mentioned by Kyle). The city took actions to
formally establish 60 dnl as the standard in our community for sound
mitigation.  Our approach of asking MAC to use the locally adopted community
standard (noise mitigation to the 60 dnl contour) succeeded. It is a big
victory that MAC staff used our local standard in preparing the map they are
recommending and which the NOC approved as an advisory to the MAC.  I
appreciate that and acknowledged on Tuesday night that it is a huge move,
beyond what any other airport in the country has done.
&gt;
&gt; Tuesday night, the FAA and MAC said they are waiting for the City’s input
about where planes should go. While Carl Rydeen of FAA made an offer that we
are following up, it was not very clear what was being offered. Another issue
is that we have not seen any proposed PBN procedures yet – they will be created
by the FAA, not the City - and they could impact everything. The FAA is
scheduled to present on RNAV to the NOC in March.  Federal and state
requirements, as well as plain old decency, require a process of review for
those proposals– with a public hearing and a separate EA.  This is not simply
in the hands of Minneapolis.  A careful evaluation of these proposed procedures
and corridors will be needed and you will be engaged in that process (as well
as residents of surrounding cities.)
&gt;
&gt; Now that we are armed with facts about what is going on above our
neighborhoods, we are exploring what can improve the situation.  Some things we
would ask for include not allowing planes to leave the runway early, not
allowing early turns, requiring planes to climb to a certain altitude above our
homes and lengthening the intervals between take-offs.  Carl Rydeen has stated
that none of these changes are possible due to FAA regulations.  If Mr. Rydeen
is constrained by FAA rules, then we will fight to change the rules.
&gt;
&gt; The city has been very aggressively working on this issue since it first came
to our attention last summer.  I personally devote a lot of time to this
because it is a high priority. Please be assured - I’m fighting for you.

      <pre class="email-body entry-content">Yes, you are correct.

But the FAA wants those planes on the ground in the air as soon as possible.
The current take-off intervals appear to be completely within their realm of
"safe."  Furthermore, departures and arrivals are happening simultaneously so a
delay in one ultimately affects the other.

The key point you're forgetting here is that the FAA doesn't make the schedules
- the individual airlines do.  Therefore, as long as it's deemed safe to depart
or land, the FAA will direct the pilots to do so.

Hope that makes sense!

You are understanding what I meant by "lengthening the times between
take-offs".  Carl Rydeen of FAA has said that they are not given the ability or
authority to tell airlines how many planes they can fly in a day or when they
can schedule such flights (note that the 11pm - 7 am quiet time we have in
place around MSP is officially voluntary!)  I take this to mean that they can
only limit the time between take-offs to something they consider safe and
cannot delay flights for other reasons. This is something we at the city need
to do a bit more research on, then probably take to another level of FAA.</pre><!--email-body-->

      <pre class="email-body entry-content">First, we need to get to the bottom of what has caused the airplane noise in
our neighborhoods to increase so dramatically. Tuesday's report by FAA did not
answer this, it was a "departure analysis" not a noise analysis.

In the PowerPoint presentation, a lot of time was spent talking about how the
"fleet mix" has changed resulting in more jets (with the implication being more
noise). The change in fleet mix likely took place over a number of years - not
overnight.

Remember this fact: before the near-accident in Sept., 2010, the noise was
tolerable; after FAA made the changes to the take off track, during winter,
2011 - the noise was intolerable. At the same time we all noticed the airplanes
were taking off much, much lower over our homes than ever before.

FAA has answered one issue with the statement that we now have 33% more flights
over our neighborhoods than before the near-miss. Carl Rydeen (FAA's top
administrator at MSP) said repeatedly over a number of meetings that he has no
clue on why we're reporting that the airplanes are flying lower overhead. He
says repeatedly that he is certain that the pilots are climbing at their
maximum safe rate on takeoff, but he has only his opinion to back that up - no
facts.

This is the CRITICAL missing piece: the planes are flying lower over our homes
and nobody will explain why that is. Until this is answered conclusively,
nothing else matters.

Make a mental note of this: Per Jim Spensley, SMAAC, when an airplane lowers
its altitude by 50%, the "Sound Intensity" on the ground increases by 8 times!

Is there a reason why the airlines might prefer to take off at a more gradual
rate? Does it save fuel? Did the airlines use the near-miss incident to change
their take-off procedures and used the FAA's change in flight tracks to be
their cover?

With all due respect to airline, FAA, MAC, and NOC employees, they need FACTS
to back up their arguments - not casual opinions. It's not enough to say of the
pilots, "I know these guys, I'm sure they're getting up there as fast as they
can." That's unprofessional; I want facts.

      <pre class="email-body entry-content">Thanks for your enthusiasm Michael!

I believe that the earlier right-turn (north turn) is a primary reason the
airplanes to be lower when they turn north, lower when they fly over our
houses, and further east than in the past. I think focusing on shifting the
"Track" back to the west should be one of our strongest demands. Aircraft
should stay on the heading of the 30R runway (northwesterly direction) for a
longer period before turning right/north. This offers three benefits:

1.) Aircraft fly over more airport-owned and non-residential property for a
longer period of time
2.) Aircraft fly over MAC-mitigated properties and less over non-mitigated
properties (the contours on the DNL noise map extend for miles to the
northwest, and only a short distance straight north). We would still hear
aircraft, but it would be more bearable, more like in years before.
3.) Aircraft would be flying at a higher altitude when flying over homes,
leading to a SIGNIFICANT decrease in noise pollution (as you mention)

Next steps:
A.) Meet as concerned, motivated neighbors (reply if you are interested)
B.) Request a meeting with our City Council Members to bring requests through
them to the Noise Oversight Committee, as we have been invited to do.

To our Council Members: please consider scheduling a public meeting of people
in Standish-Ericsson, Powderhorn, Phillips, Corcoran, Bancroft and other
newly-affected neighborhoods. I request to be a part of any such meeting.

Thanks!

&gt; Remember this fact: before the near-accident in Sept., 2010, the noise was
tolerable; after FAA made the changes to the take off track, during winter,
2011 - the noise was intolerable. At the same time we all noticed the airplanes
were taking off much, much lower over our homes than ever before.
&gt;
&gt; FAA has answered one issue with the statement that we now have 33% more
flights over our neighborhoods than before the near-miss. Carl Rydeen (FAA's
top administrator at MSP) said repeatedly over a number of meetings that he has
no clue on why we're reporting that the airplanes are flying lower overhead. He
says repeatedly that he is certain that the pilots are climbing at their
maximum safe rate on takeoff, but he has only his opinion to back that up - no
facts.
&gt;
&gt; This is the CRITICAL missing piece: the planes are flying lower over our
homes and nobody will explain why that is. Until this is answered conclusively,
nothing else matters.
&gt;
&gt; Make a mental note of this: Per Jim Spensley, SMAAC, when an airplane lowers
its altitude by 50%, the "Sound Intensity" on the ground increases by 8 times!
&gt;
&gt; Is there a reason why the airlines might prefer to take off at a more gradual
rate? Does it save fuel? Did the airlines use the near-miss incident to change
their take-off procedures and used the FAA's change in flight tracks to be
their cover?
&gt;
&gt; With all due respect to airline, FAA, MAC, and NOC employees, they need FACTS
to back up their arguments - not casual opinions. It's not enough to say of the
pilots, "I know these guys, I'm sure they're getting up there as fast as they
can." That's unprofessional; I want facts.</pre><!--email-body-->

      <pre class="email-body entry-content">I was also at the meeting on Tuesday (I'm a 10-year Powderhorn resident, but
lived in Standish-Ericsson for 8 years before that). Lots of good discussion
here.


&gt;From a personal standpoint, I don't want mitigation for my house; I want to be
able to use my back yard during the short and precious warm-weather months.

I think it is probably true that we are not likely to see noise levels return
to 2010 levels (which doesn't mean that we shouldn't push for it anyway);
however, I, for one, would be somewhat satisfied if the noise were not so
RELENTLESS, i.e., barrages of low-altitude noise at approximately 3 hour
intervals from 7 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. EVERY.SINGLE.DAY.

As noted by some other commenters above, if planes were higher and less
frequent, this would also go a long way toward making the noise issue more
tolerable. That said, the FAA, while a public agency (presumably paid for by
us, the public), is essentially there to serve the airlines. (In fairness to
the individual air traffic controllers, I understand that they have a mandate;
the decision/changes have to come from further up the chain.)

At any rate, it seems to me that we need to pursue this along several
coordinated fronts: through our councilmembers: Colvin-Roy (thank you, by the
way), Quincy, Schiff and Glidden, to present a comprehensive plan to NOC; I
wonder if arguing for environmental issues as in effects on human hearing,
mental health (like higher levels of cortisol/stress hormone, for example) etc.
is worth pursuing). It also sounds as though pursuing the specific noise
intensity levels (rather than simply the number and path of departures) is
worth pursuing. Where/how can we find an expert on that?

Also working with  as our representatives in Congress -- Sens. Klobuchar and
Franken, and Ellison for my part of Minneapolis (I think he represents
Standish-Ericsson etc., but not sure), since FAA is federal agency (and, again,
at least nominally a public agency).

At one point there was an airport noise listserv/forum which was useful for
connecting all the affected neighborhoods in South Minneapolis; anyone know
what happened to that?

On a related note, I think those of us who can should meet -- SOON -- to
strategize various approaches (NOC/councilmembers, FAA/members of Congress,
perhaps other protest actions that draw news media attention) so we can have a
coordinated and strong approach.

As we all know, there's a lot at stake, including our property values, health
(physical and mental) and quality of life. The powers that be are not going to
do anything about this unless we make it clear we are willing to fight for
improvement.</pre><!--email-body-->

I think one of our primary demands has to be to move the "track" to
the west, keeping airplanes flying along the heading of the 30R runway
for a longer distance before turning north. We cannot accept any
excuse that says we can't do that. They need to fly over airport
property for longer distances and then over mitigated homes when they
are higher.

      <pre class="email-body entry-content">Jason Stone - That's the impression I was left with from what I heard too.
That's at least 3 of us left with the same impression.

Council Member John Quincy:
You are our City Council Member sitting on the NOC.
The MAC, NOC, and FAA extended an invitation directly to you and Council Member
Colvin-Roy to propose solutions on residents behalf during the MAC public input
meeting last week.  That was a big surprise to us all and exciting. I know that
you and Council Member Colvin Roy are on our side and I wish for yours and
residents sake that you could have been present at that meeting last week so
that you could have had a more productive open dialogue. C'est la vie.

Could you please chime in on this forum?  Because of what was said and the
impression that residents were left with, many of us are looking to you with
hope that you are the person who can help us to expedite progress bringing
peace and quiet back to the skies of our neighborhoods. Reading your
perspective and agenda on this forum in a reply would be helpful to us all.</pre><!--email-body-->

      <pre class="email-body entry-content">After that verbal veto, Michael Kehoe requested some greater creativity by MAC,
FAA, and NOC to resolve our noise problem.  Then Michael suggested fanning on a
schedule.  For example, flying planes all on the same conforming track over a
line of neighborhoods Mondays and then a track over a different line of
neighborhoods Tuesdays,  and then a different track over another line of
neghborhoods Thursday, etc....so no tracks are intersecting (keeping the planes
safe), and dispersing the noise pollution to more neighborhoods so no one
neighborhood suffers all the time while all others never suffer.

I am also aware that the FAA requires "over any congested area of a city, town,

feet above the highest obstacle within a horizontal radius of 2,000 feet of the
aircraft."  (see <a href="http://www.risingup.com/fars/info/part91-119-FAR.shtml">http://www.risingup.com/fars/info/part91-119-FAR.shtml</a> )

Currently the FAA is enforcing this - the planes over our neighbourhoods are
several hundred feet higher than required.  According to the noise committee,
the airport is meeting sound standards.  Therefore, nothing NEEDS to be done.
Based upon this, why would the FAA agree to a rotating schedule that could, as
a result of human error, create an accident?

While they may empathise with our shaking windows and lack of sleep, the FAA
will not agree to anything that may potentially cause an accident.  If a
rotating schedule is the best we've got, I think it's time to head back to the
drawing board.</pre><!--email-body-->

      <pre class="email-body entry-content">My pilot friend, he flies big jets to Europe for Delta as well as flights over
our home, says the tower tells the pilots at take off, "heading 360 degrees"
that's due north over our houses.  Their first goal is to reach 7000 feet.  FAA
Rydeen said the  tower is not telling individual pilots, who know the
characteristics of their particular airplane, like how full it is, passengers,
cargo, and other factors, air temp etc., how fast to climb.  I myself am
confused about the definition of 'fanning' or 'track dispersal', or effects of
'wake turbulence' this far from the airport.  There is a MAC Commissioner who
was a pilot, who may be helpful to us.  Name is in my file somewhere.</pre><!--email-body-->

      <pre class="email-body entry-content">Odia,
I'm confused.  I am uncertain and do not want to assume you are trying to be
the devils advocate.  Are you?  We are all suffering from the airplane
noise...(right?) and we post on this forum attempting in our own ways to
contribute to a positive collaboration towards the solutions that will relieve
us of the noise pollution. (right?)
If you are not part of the FAA (I think) you can't absolutely know what
proposals the FAA will or will not shoot down. ( right?). I am trying to
believe that you mean well and that we are on the same side of this issue so I
wanted to share with you that If you are trying to play the devils advocate
your comments presently are not coming across as "what if...", ( to stir the
pot) and instead are matter of fact criticisms, shutting down the positive
thinking.  By Cutting down our neighbors creative solutions to the problem as
if we held the authority ourselves to make those decisions, it spreads
negativity among our community activists,  shuts down peoples motivation to
contribute their own creative solutions out of fear that someone on their own
side will cut them down too.  Proposing solutions inspires hope and chopping
down other peoples proposed solutions  inspires a defeatist attitude.
I totally agree with you that having more proposed creative solutions to our
problem on our drawing board will benefit our cause. The more we all can come
up with the better.  That could add to some positive momentum and possibly a
positive result.
If you can inspire some much needed hope by proposing any of your own solutions
to our airplane noise problem that you think might stand a chance gaining the
FAA support, I think everyone here would LOVE to read them.  I know that i
would. I really would like to come up with some to share too and I know it's
tough to do.  Please, don't cut mine down if I post some. Please?

Kind Regards,

Jason Stempel

      <pre class="email-body entry-content">The Metropolitan Airports Commission (MAC) is processing an Environmental
Assessment (EA) comparing two scenarios for expanding MSP to meet a “projected”
need for more operations in 2020 and beyond.  The alternatives all ignore the
increased, low and loud overflights in Standish-Ericsson and adjacent
neighborhoods resulting from changed operations.

So, with respect to noise, all alternatives are more flights, more noise.  The
Noise Oversight Committee has already wrongly concluded that noise will be
reduced due to (projected) less-noisy aircraft and unfunded precision
navigation systems.

But wait, would the EA approval prevent airlines from flying noisier aircraft
instead? No.   Would it require MSP to install and airlines to have and use
only aircraft equipped with precision navigation components? No. Will the
flight path changes made last year (after the near-mid-air collision of
September 2010) that inundated Standish-Ericsson and adjacent neighborhoods be
continued or revised? Not part of the EA.

As the odds are that MAC will not listen or act, citizens can ask elected
officials to intervene.

Congressman Ellison is already making inquiries aout lowering runway use rates
for greater safety and less noise, encourage him!

Governor Dayton called for more openness and transparency by the MAC, make him
aware that keeping the operational changes out of the EA process is unfair if
not illegtimate, and that the factsa do not support their conclusions in the
draft EA, complain to him!

The City of Minneapolis has been frequently rebuffed by NOC (and MAC): ask the
Mayor and your Council Member why they defer NOC By-Laws that detour City
requests and why the Mayor's MAC representative doesn't question NOC
recommendations that adversely impact Minneapolis.
